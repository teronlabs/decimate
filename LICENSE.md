# Decimate LICENSE files

Decimate is a Python library published by [Teron Labs](https://www.teronlabs.com/) (<info@teronlabs.com>) for running decimation testing on data from a non-IID [(independent and identically distributed)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables) noise source.

The IID testing used by [Teron Labs](https://www.teronlabs.com/)' Decimate Python library is from NIST's C++ [SP800-90B_EntropyAssessment](https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_EntropyAssessment) tool. Teron Labs modified the tool slightly and made it into a Python extension module called `stats90b`. 

There are two licences for files in this project.
